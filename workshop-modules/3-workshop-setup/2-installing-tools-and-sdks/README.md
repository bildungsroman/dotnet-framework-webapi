# Installing Tools and SDKs
To complete this workshop we'll need a few additional tools and SDKs.

## .NET Core SDK
Building a .NET Core Lambda Function requires the .NET Core SDK and Runtime. Click [this link](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) then click the **Download .NET Core SDK** button to download the SDK for your OS, then complete the installation process.

> Note that we are downloading the current [Long-Term Support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) (LTS) version: *.NET Core 3.1*. AWS Lambda does not support .NET 5 as it is not an LTS release.

## Your Favorite IDE or Editor
We suggest using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it provides a free, comprehensive, and cross-platform development experience, but you can use any IDE or editor you prefer.

If you use Visual Studio Code, you will also want to install its [C# Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) to help with syntax highlighting, intellisense completion, and more.

We're all set up now! Let's start the [Modernization](../../4-modernize-the-api/README.md).
